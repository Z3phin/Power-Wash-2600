atari-2600-project
=====

This project is part of my Year 3 Dissertation project at Swansea University. 
The goal of this project is to adapt a modern game to an 8-bit console. 
In this case, it is an adaption of Power Wash Simulator to the Atari VCS/2600 console. 
Coded in 6502 assembly, the game combines many of the learnings from segments in the book "Making Games for the Atari 2600" by Steven Hugg. 
Much of the code as been originally taken from this book and altered to suit the specification of this project.
